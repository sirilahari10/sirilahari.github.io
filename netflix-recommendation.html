        <p>Ever notice how Netflix always seems one step ahead of you? You finish a show, and instantly—almost like it read your mind, the perfect next recommendation pops up. It’s not luck, and it’s definitely not magic. Behind the scenes, data science is working overtime: tracking your habits, learning your tastes, and predicting what you’ll love next. It's a proof that the smartest recommendations aren’t guesses, they’re data in disguise..</p>

        <h2>🔍 It’s All About Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Netflix’s entire business depends on one question: “What should we show you so you keep watching?”</p>
        <p>To answer that, it uses a few clever strategies:</p>

        <h3>1. Collaborative Filtering</h3>
        <p>If you and someone else both loved <em>Stranger Things</em>, and they also liked <em>Dark</em>, Netflix figures you might enjoy <em>Dark</em> too. It’s like getting a recommendation from someone with eerily similar taste.</p>

        <h3>2. Content-Based Filtering</h3>
        <p>This method focuses on the shows themselves. If you’ve watched a bunch of sci-fi thrillers, Netflix will suggest more sci-fi — even if no one else is watching them. It’s about matching the ingredients of what you already like.</p>

        <h3>3. Hybrid Models</h3>
        <p>Netflix blends collaborative and content-based methods, adding context like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What time of day you’re watching</li>
            <li>What device you’re using</li>
            <li>Whether you finish episodes or drop off halfway</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📖 When Netflix Got It Wrong (And Learned From It)</h2>
        <p>One night, I was winding down and looking for something light. I’d just finished Never Have I Ever and was hoping for another feel-good series. Netflix suggested You. If you’ve seen it, you know, it’s not light. It's  psychological thriller meets stalker drama. Definitely not the vibe.
I clicked anyway (curiosity won), but bailed halfway through the first episode. The next day, my recommendations shifted. Suddenly, I was seeing more rom-coms, less murder. 
That moment stuck with me. It reminded me that these systems aren’t static, they learn from what we click, what we skip, and even what we abandon. Every action is feedback.</p>

        <h2>💻 Try It Yourself: A Mini Recommender</h2>
        <p>Curious how this works under the hood? I built a simple demo using Python and Streamlit. Here’s how it works:</p>
        <iframe src="https://sirilahari10-sirilahari-github-io-app-5fdozj.streamlit.app//" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <ul>
            <li>Rate a few shows</li>
            <li>The app compares your ratings with others</li>
            <li>It recommends titles based on collaborative filtering and content clues</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>🚀 Why This Matters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🎶 Spotify curates your vibe</li>
            <li>🛒 Amazon nudges your next impulse buy</li>
            <li>👩‍💻 LinkedIn lines up your next job</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Recommendation systems quietly shape how we discover things, make decisions, and spend our time. Building this demo showed me how even simple models can teach a lot about personalization and feedback.</p>

        <h2>✅ Final Takeaway</h2>
        <p>Next time Netflix nails your mood, remember there’s a whole world of math, modeling, and experimentation behind that single suggestion. Curious? Build your own recommender and see it in action!</p>
