    <h1>Decoded: How Netflix Knows What You’ll Watch Next</h1>

        <p>Ever notice how Netflix seems to know exactly what you’re in the mood for — even before you do? You finish one show, and the next suggestion feels oddly perfect. That’s not luck. It’s data science doing what it does best: learning your habits and making smart predictions.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>🔎 The Core Idea: Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Netflix’s system is built to answer one question:</p>
        <blockquote>“What should we show you so you keep watching?”</blockquote>
        <p>To do this, they combine three key approaches:</p>
        
        <h3>Collaborative Filtering</h3>
        <p>Looks at users who watch similar things. If you loved Stranger Things and someone else did too — and they also loved Dark — Netflix might suggest Dark to you. It’s basically “people like you also liked…” in algorithm form.</p>
        
        <h3>Content-Based Filtering</h3>
        <p>Focuses on the characteristics of shows themselves: genre, actors, keywords, tone. If you watch sci-fi thrillers with strong leads, Netflix can suggest similar titles even if your viewers-with-similar-tastes data is slim.</p>
        
        <h3>Hybrid Models</h3>
        <p>Netflix doesn’t rely on a single trick — it mixes collaborative and content-based approaches, plus contextual signals like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What time of day you’re watching</li>
            <li>What device you’re on</li>
            <li>Whether you finish episodes or drop off</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That hybrid approach makes recommendations more accurate and personalized.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>📊 Why It Works So Well</h2>
        <p>Netflix runs continuous A/B tests — different users see slightly different recommendations, thumbnails, and layouts. The company measures what makes people click and what keeps them watching. Even the thumbnail for a single movie can differ from user to user to improve engagement.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>📖 When Netflix Got It Wrong (And Learned)</h2>
        <p>One night I’d just finished a light rom-com and hoped for something similar. Netflix suggested You — a psychological thriller. Not the vibe. I clicked, bailed halfway through, and the next day saw more rom-coms and fewer murder dramas. The system took my behavior as feedback and adapted.</p>
        <p>Note: That small feedback loop — clicks, skips, watch-time — is how recommendation systems learn in production.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>💻 Try It Yourself: A Mini Recommender</h2>
        <p>I built a simple demo in Python + Streamlit that demonstrates the basic idea: you rate a few shows, and the app suggests titles based on collaborative filtering and simple content filters. It’s not Netflix-level, but it’s a great hands-on way to learn.</p>
        <p><a href="https://netflix-demo.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">Interactive Demo →</a></p>
        <p>Exercise: Open the demo and rate 3–5 shows. Notice which recommendations feel spot on — and which don’t. Try changing one rating and see how the suggestions change.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>🚀 Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Recommendation systems power more than TV: Spotify creates your Discover Weekly, Amazon suggests products, and LinkedIn recommends jobs. These systems influence the products people discover and choose — a huge impact on user experience and business metrics.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>✅ Takeaway</h2>
        <p>Next time Netflix recommends something you love (or hates), remember there’s a whole pipeline of data, models, A/B tests, and product thinking behind that one suggestion. If you’re learning data science, building even a small recommender is an excellent way to practice modeling, evaluation, and user-focused design.</p>
