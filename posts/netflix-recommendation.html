    <h1>Decoded: How Netflix Knows What You’ll Watch Next</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By Siri Lahari — September 9, 2025</p>
</header>

    <section>
        <p>Ever notice how Netflix seems to know exactly what you’re in the mood for — even before you do? You finish one show, and the next suggestion feels oddly perfect. That’s not luck. It’s data science in action: learning your habits and making smart predictions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>🔎 The Core Idea: Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Netflix’s system answers one simple question:</p>
        <blockquote>“What should we show you so you keep watching?”</blockquote>
        <p>To do this, they combine three key approaches:</p>

        <h3>1. Collaborative Filtering</h3>
        <p>Looks at users with similar tastes. If you loved <em>Stranger Things</em> and someone else did too — and they also loved <em>Dark</em> — Netflix might suggest <em>Dark</em> to you. Think: “people like you also liked…” in algorithm form.</p>

        <h3>2. Content-Based Filtering</h3>
        <p>Focuses on the shows themselves: genre, actors, tone, keywords. Watched a sci-fi thriller with strong leads? Netflix may suggest similar titles, even without much “people like you” data.</p>

        <h3>3. Hybrid Models</h3>
        <p>Netflix mixes both approaches along with contextual signals like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Time of day you’re watching</li>
            <li>Device you’re on</li>
            <li>Whether you finish episodes or drop off</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This hybrid approach makes recommendations more accurate and personalized.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>📊 Why It Works So Well</h2>
        <p>Netflix runs continuous A/B tests — showing slightly different layouts, thumbnails, and recommendations to different users. They track what makes people click and what keeps them watching. Even the thumbnail for the same movie can differ from user to user to boost engagement.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>📖 When Netflix Got It Wrong (And Learned)</h2>
        <p>One night I had just finished a light rom-com. Netflix suggested <em>You</em> — a psychological thriller. Not exactly the vibe I wanted.</p>
        <p>I clicked, bailed halfway through, and the next day saw more rom-coms and fewer thrillers. The system adapted based on my behavior — every click, skip, and watch-time counts as feedback.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>💻 Try It Yourself: A Mini Recommender</h2>
        <p>I built a <strong>mini Netflix demo</strong> using Python + Streamlit to illustrate the idea:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rate a few shows — just a handful.</li>
            <li>The app compares your ratings with a small dataset of other users.</li>
            <li>See which shows it recommends based on collaborative filtering and content hints.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s not Netflix-level, but it’s surprisingly fun to see how a few ratings can lead to solid recommendations.</p>
        <p><a href="https://netflix-demo.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">▶ Open Interactive Demo</a></p>
        <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Rate 3–5 shows and see which recommendations feel spot-on. Try changing one rating — notice how the suggestions update!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>🚀 Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Recommendation systems aren’t just for Netflix:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spotify curates your Discover Weekly 🎶</li>
            <li>Amazon suggests products you might like 🛒</li>
            <li>LinkedIn recommends jobs 👩‍💻</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a data enthusiast, I love seeing how algorithms + real-world data can enhance our everyday experiences. Building this demo reinforced how even simple models can teach us a lot about user behavior and personalization.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>✅ Takeaway</h2>
        <p>Next time Netflix recommends a show you love (or hate), remember: there’s a whole world of math, data, and testing behind that single suggestion. Building your own recommender is a fantastic way to learn about modeling, evaluation, and user-focused design.</p>
