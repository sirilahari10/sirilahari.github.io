      <h1>Decoded: How Netflix Knows What You’ll Watch Next</h1>

        <p><strong>Ever notice how Netflix seems to know exactly what you’re in the mood for — even before you do?</strong> You finish one show, and the next suggestion feels oddly perfect. That’s not luck. It’s data science doing what it does best: learning your habits and making smart predictions.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="block">
        <h2>🔎 The Core Idea: Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Netflix’s system is built to answer one question:</p>
        <p><em>“What should we show you so you keep watching?”</em></p>
        <p>To do this, they combine three key approaches:</p>

        <h3>Collaborative Filtering</h3>
        <p>Looks at users who watch similar things. If you loved <em>Stranger Things</em> and someone else did too — and they also loved <em>Dark</em> — Netflix might suggest <em>Dark</em> to you. It’s basically “people like you also liked…” in algorithm form.</p>

        <h3>Content-Based Filtering</h3>
        <p>Focuses on the characteristics of shows themselves: genre, actors, keywords, tone. If you watch sci-fi thrillers with strong leads, Netflix can suggest similar titles even if your viewers-with-similar-tastes data is slim.</p>

        <h3>Hybrid Models</h3>
        <p>Netflix doesn’t rely on a single trick — it mixes collaborative and content-based approaches, plus contextual signals like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What time of day you’re watching</li>
          <li>What device you’re on</li>
          <li>Whether you finish episodes or drop off</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That hybrid approach makes recommendations more accurate and personalized.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="block">
        <h2>📊 Why It Works So Well</h2>
        <p>Netflix runs continuous A/B tests — different users see slightly different recommendations, thumbnails, and layouts. The company measures what makes people click and what keeps them watching. Even the thumbnail for a single movie can differ from user to user to improve engagement.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="block">
        <h2>📖 When Netflix Got It Wrong (And Learned)</h2>
        <p>One night I’d just finished a light rom-com and hoped for something similar. Netflix suggested <em>You</em> — a psychological thriller. Not the vibe. I clicked, bailed halfway through, and the next day saw more rom-coms and fewer murder dramas. The system took my behavior as feedback and adapted.</p>
        <div class="note">
          <strong>Note:</strong> That small feedback loop — clicks, skips, watch-time — is how recommendation systems learn in production.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="block">
        <h2>💻 Try It Yourself: A Mini Recommender</h2>
        <p>I built a simple demo in Python + Streamlit that demonstrates the basic idea: you rate a few shows, and the app suggests titles based on collaborative filtering and simple content filters. It’s not Netflix-level, but it’s a great hands-on way to learn.</p>

        <h3>Interactive Demo</h3>
        <iframe class="blog-iframe" src="STREAMLIT_URL" title="Netflix Recommendation Demo (Streamlit)"></iframe>

        <div class="exercise">
          <strong>Exercise:</strong> Open the demo and rate 3–5 shows. Notice which recommendations feel spot on — and which don’t. Try changing one rating and see how the suggestions change.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="block">
        <h2>🚀 Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Recommendation systems power more than TV: Spotify creates your Discover Weekly, Amazon suggests products, and LinkedIn recommends jobs. These systems influence the products people discover and choose — a huge impact on user experience and business metrics.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="block">
        <h2>✅ Takeaway</h2>
        <p>Next time Netflix recommends something you love (or hates), remember there’s a whole pipeline of data, models, A/B tests, and product thinking behind that one suggestion. If you’re learning data science, building even a small recommender is an excellent way to practice modeling, evaluation, and user-focused design.</p>
