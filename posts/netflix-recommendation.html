        <p>You know that moment when you finish a show and Netflix instantly lines up something new — and it’s exactly what you’re in the mood for? It’s easy to forget there’s no person behind the curtain. Just a system that’s gotten really good at understanding what makes you tick.</p>

        <h2>🔍 It’s All About Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Netflix’s entire business depends on one question: “What should we show you so you keep watching?”</p>
        <p>To answer that, it uses a few clever strategies:</p>

        <h3>1. Collaborative Filtering</h3>
        <p>If you and someone else both loved <em>Stranger Things</em>, and they also liked <em>Dark</em>, Netflix figures you might enjoy <em>Dark</em> too. It’s like getting a recommendation from someone with eerily similar taste.</p>

        <h3>2. Content-Based Filtering</h3>
        <p>This method focuses on the shows themselves. If you’ve watched a bunch of sci-fi thrillers, Netflix will suggest more sci-fi — even if no one else is watching them. It’s about matching the ingredients of what you already like.</p>

        <h3>3. Hybrid Models</h3>
        <p>Netflix blends collaborative and content-based methods, adding context like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What time of day you’re watching</li>
            <li>What device you’re using</li>
            <li>Whether you finish episodes or drop off halfway</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📖 When Netflix Got It Wrong (And Learned From It)</h2>
        <p>One night, I was looking for something light to watch. I’d just finished <em>Never Have I Ever</em> and was hoping for another feel-good series. Netflix suggested <em>You</em>. Not light — definitely a psychological thriller. I clicked anyway but bailed halfway. The next day, my recommendations shifted. More rom-coms, less murder. Every click and skip is a signal that teaches the algorithm.</p>

        <p>Curious how this works under the hood? Check out the demo:</p>
        <iframe src="https://sirilahari10-sirilahari-github-io-app-5fdozj.streamlit.app/" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <ul>
            <li>Rate a few shows</li>
            <li>The app compares your ratings with others</li>
            <li>It recommends titles based on collaborative filtering and content clues</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🚀 Why This Matters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🎶 Spotify curates your vibe</li>
            <li>🛒 Amazon nudges your next impulse buy</li>
            <li>👩‍💻 LinkedIn lines up your next job</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Recommendation systems quietly shape how we discover things, make decisions, and spend our time. Building this demo showed me how even simple models can teach a lot about personalization and feedback.</p>

        <h2>✅ Final Takeaway</h2>
        <p>Next time Netflix nails your mood, remember there’s a whole world of math, modeling, and experimentation behind that single suggestion. Curious? Build your own recommender and see it in action!</p>
