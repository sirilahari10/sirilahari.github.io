Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm starting this blog to share practical notes from my day-to-day work studying and building in **data science and ML** â€” tips that helped me, write-ups of projects, and short explainers I wish existed when I got stuck.

**What to expect**
- Bite-sized tutorials and checklists
- Project write-ups (code + lessons learned)
- Interview prep nuggets and study logs

If you'd like updates, bookmark this site and say hello on LinkedIn. Letâ€™s build!
